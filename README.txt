Summary:
The Zodiac "deciphering ciphers"
In this audio narrative, I am diving into the ciphers which the Zodiac killer wrote and sent to multiple news agencies. In these letters, he claimed responsibility for a number of murders, as well as taunted police authorities, and expressed anger with their choices on the case. The most notable parts of these letters were the symbols that the zodiac arranged in a certain pattern, trying to assert dominance over authorities as they scratched their heads at these compelling symbols. The most famous cipher is what I'll be investigating in this audio narrative, aka the 308 word cipher.
